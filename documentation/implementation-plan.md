# Wittgenstein Interpretation Explorer: Implementation Plan

## 1. Detailed Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
#### Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- Set up GitHub repository with proper branching strategy
- Initialize React TypeScript project with Next.js
- Set up Express backend with TypeScript
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing frameworks
- Create CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

#### Week 2: Core Infrastructure
- Implement Pinecone vector database integration
- Set up OpenAI API integration
- Create basic API endpoints for query processing
- Develop data models and type definitions

#### Week 3: Basic UI Components
- Create responsive layout with mobile-first approach
- Implement chat interface with basic styling
- Design and implement loading states and animations
- Create basic error handling components

#### Week 4: MVP Integration
- Connect frontend and backend
- Implement basic query flow
- Create simple interpretation display
- Test end-to-end functionality

### Phase 2: Framework Integration (Weeks 5-7)
#### Week 5: Interpretation Frameworks
- Implement all nine interpretative frameworks
- Create prompts for OpenAI to generate framework-specific interpretations
- Develop metadata structure for framework relationships
- Test interpretation quality with sample queries

#### Week 6: Advanced UI Components
- Implement collapsible/expandable interpretation sections
- Create visual indicators for framework relationships
- Develop highlighting system for key concepts
- Implement citation display

#### Week 7: Process Transparency & Transaction Theory
- Create visual representation of RAG process
- Implement Transaction Theory namespace integration
- Develop educational tooltips for technical processes
- Create "About" section with technology explanations

### Phase 3: Refinement (Weeks 8-9)
#### Week 8: Performance Optimization
- Implement caching strategies for common queries
- Optimize vector search parameters
- Add response time monitoring
- Conduct load testing and optimize bottlenecks

#### Week 9: UX Enhancements & Testing
- Implement suggested starter questions
- Add conversation history functionality
- Conduct usability testing with target audience
- Fix identified UX issues and bugs

### Phase 4: Launch Preparation (Week 10)
- Final QA testing
- Documentation completion
- Deployment to production environment
- Monitoring setup and alert configuration

## 2. Resource Allocation

### Development Team
- 1 Frontend Developer (Full-time)
- 1 Backend Developer (Full-time)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (Part-time)
- 1 AI/ML Engineer (Part-time)
- 1 Project Manager (Part-time)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Pinecone vector database subscription
- OpenAI API credits
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- CI/CD pipeline

### External Dependencies
- Access to Wittgenstein's works for vectorization
- Transaction Theory documentation
- Expert review for interpretation quality

## 3. Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **API Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API may impose rate limits affecting response times
   - *Mitigation*: Implement queuing system and optimize prompt efficiency

2. **Vector Search Quality**: Poor search results may lead to irrelevant interpretations
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with diverse queries and refinement of vector embeddings

3. **Response Time**: Complex queries may exceed the 15-second response time target
   - *Mitigation*: Implement progressive loading and optimize backend processing

4. **Interpretation Accuracy**: LLM-generated interpretations may contain inaccuracies
   - *Mitigation*: Expert review of framework prompts and sample outputs

### Contingency Plans
- Fallback to simpler interpretation model if response times are consistently high
- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed content
- Develop offline processing option for complex queries

## 4. Milestone Tracking

### Milestone 1: MVP Completion (End of Week 4)
- Basic query processing and interpretation
- Functional chat interface
- End-to-end data flow
